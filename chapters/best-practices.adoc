The best practices presented in this section are not part of the actual
guidelines, but should provide guidance for common challenges we face when
implementing RESTful APIs.


[[optimistic-locking]]
== Optimistic locking in RESTful APIs

=== Introduction
[yellow-background]#Optimistic locking might be used to avoid concurrent writes on the same entity,
which might cause data loss.# A client always has to retrieve a copy of an
entity first and specifically update this one. If another version has been
created in the meantime, the update should fail. In order to make this work,
the client has to provide some kind of version reference, which is checked by
the service, before the update is executed. Please read the more detailed
description on how to update resources via {PUT} in the <<put, HTTP Requests
Section>>.

A RESTful API usually includes some kind of search endpoint, which will then
return a list of result entities. There are several ways to implement
optimistic locking in combination with search endpoints which, depending on the
approach chosen, might lead to performing additional requests to get the
current version of the entity that should be updated.

=== `ETag` with `If-Match` header
[yellow-background]#An {ETag} can only be obtained by performing a {GET} request on the single
entity resource before the update, i.e. when using a search endpoint an
additional request is necessary.#

Example:
[source,http]
----
< GET /orders

> HTTP/1.1 200 OK
> {
>   "items": [
>     { "id": "O0000042" },
>     { "id": "O0000043" }
>   ]
> }

< GET /orders/BO0000042

> HTTP/1.1 200 OK
> ETag: osjnfkjbnkq3jlnksjnvkjlsbf
> { "id": "BO0000042", ... }

< PUT /orders/O0000042
< If-Match: osjnfkjbnkq3jlnksjnvkjlsbf
< { "id": "O0000042", ... }

> HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
----

Or, if there was an update since the {GET} and the entity's {ETag} has changed:

[source,http]
----
> HTTP/1.1 412 Precondition failed
----

==== Pros
* RESTful solution

==== Cons
* [yellow-background]#Many additional requests are necessary to build a meaningful front-end#

[[etag-in-result-entities]]
=== `ETags` in result entities
[yellow-background]#The ETag for every entity is returned as an additional property of that entity.#
In a response containing multiple entities, every entity will then have a
distinct {ETag} that can be used in subsequent {PUT} requests.

In this solution, the `etag` property should be `readonly` and never be expected
in the {PUT} request payload.

Example:
[source,http]
----
< GET /orders

> HTTP/1.1 200 OK
> {
>   "items": [
>     { "id": "O0000042", "etag": "osjnfkjbnkq3jlnksjnvkjlsbf", "foo": 42, "bar": true },
>     { "id": "O0000043", "etag": "kjshdfknjqlowjdsljdnfkjbkn", "foo": 24, "bar": false }
>   ]
> }

< PUT /orders/O0000042
< If-Match: osjnfkjbnkq3jlnksjnvkjlsbf
< { "id": "O0000042", "foo": 43, "bar": true }

> HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
----

Or, if there was an update since the {GET} and the entity's {ETag} has changed:

[source,http]
----
> HTTP/1.1 412 Precondition failed
----

==== Pros
* Perfect optimistic locking

==== Cons
* [yellow-background]#Information that only belongs in the HTTP header is part of the business
  objects#
* [yellow-background]#The representation of a collection of Resources is different from the representation of a
  single resource#

=== Version numbers
[yellow-background]#This is what we typically use in JPA/Hibernate.#
The entities contain a property with a version number. When an update is
performed, this version number is given back to the service as part of the
payload. The service performs a check on that version number to make sure it
was not incremented since the consumer got the resource and performs the
update, [yellow-background]#incrementing the version number, which modifies the resource#

[yellow-background]#Since this operation implies a modification of the resource by the service, a
{POST} operation on the exact resource (e.g. `POST /orders/O0000042`) should be
used instead of a {PUT}.#

In this solution, the `version` property is not `readonly` since it is provided
at {POST} time as part of the payload.

Example:
[source,http]
----
< GET /orders

> HTTP/1.1 200 OK
> {
>   "items": [
>     { "id": "O0000042", "version": 1,  "foo": 42, "bar": true },
>     { "id": "O0000043", "version": 42, "foo": 24, "bar": false }
>   ]
> }

< POST /orders/O0000042
< { "id": "O0000042", "version": 1, "foo": 43, "bar": true }

> HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
----

or if there was an update since the {GET} and the version number in the
database is higher than the one given in the request body:

[source,http]
----
> HTTP/1.1 409 Conflict
----

==== Pros
* Perfect optimistic locking

==== Cons
* [yellow-background]#Functionality that belongs into the HTTP header becomes part of the
  business object#
* [yellow-background]#Using {POST} instead of PUT for an update logic (not a problem in itself,
  but may feel unusual for the consumer)#

=== `Last-Modified` / `If-Unmodified-Since`
In HTTP 1.0 there was no {ETag} and the mechanism used for [yellow-background]#optimistic
locking was based on a date - with a precision limited to seconds.#
This is still part of the HTTP protocol and can be used.
Every response contains a {Last-Modified} header with a HTTP date. When
requesting an update using a {PUT} request, the client has to provide this
value via the header {If-Unmodified-Since}. The server rejects the request, if
the last modified date of the entity is after the given date in the header.

This effectively catches any situations where a change that happened between
{GET} and {PUT} would be overwritten. In the case of multiple result entities,
the {Last-Modified} header will be set to the latest date of all the entities.
This ensures that any change to any of the entities that happens between {GET}
and {PUT} will be detectable, without locking the rest of the batch as well.

Example:
[source,http]
----
< GET /orders

> HTTP/1.1 200 OK
> Last-Modified: Wed, 22 Jul 2009 19:15:56 GMT
> {
>   "items": [
>     { "id": "O0000042", ... },
>     { "id": "O0000043", ... }
>   ]
> }

< PUT /block/O0000042
< If-Unmodified-Since: Wed, 22 Jul 2009 19:15:56 GMT
< { "id": "O0000042", ... }

> HTTP/1.1 204 No Content
----

Or, if there was an update since the {GET} and the entities last modified is
later than the given date:

[source,http]
----
> HTTP/1.1 412 Precondition failed
----

==== Pros
* Well established approach that has been working for a long time
* No interference with the business objects; the locking is done via HTTP
  headers only
* Very easy to implement
* No additional request needed when updating an entity of a search endpoint
  result

==== Cons
* [yellow-background]#If a client communicates with two different instances and their clocks are
  not perfectly in sync, the locking could potentially fail#
* [yellow-background]#If multiple changes happen within one second, only the first one will succeeed.#

=== Conclusion
[yellow-background]#If modifications of our resource don't happen that often and impact of mistakes is limited,
we use the _{Last-Modified} / {If-Unmodified-Since}_ approach. If the resources have strong consistency
requirements and mistakes cause major damage, we go for `ETag` with `If-Match` header and take the
performance penalty.#
